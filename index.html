    <h2> How Joanne Rowling became J. K. Rowling... </h2>
    <p><span class="year">1964 </span>Aircraft engineer Peter James Rowling and science technician Anne Rowling met on a train departing from King's Cross Station. Little did they know that King's Cross Station would be where their daughter would set the
        stage for the infamous platform 9&frac34--a gateway into a fictional wizarding world.

    <h2>In the beginning...</h2>
    <p><span class="year">1965-83 </span>As a child, J. K. Rowling compares herself to her own character Hermione Granger--studious and albeit sometimes pedantic. Growing up, Rowling's fantasy world began to formulate as she wrote and read her stories
        to her younger sister, Diane. Rowling's great-aunt introduced Rowling to the writing of Jessica Mitford. Jessic Milford is the writer of "Hons and Rebels"--an autobiography which describes Mitford's aristocratic childhood and conflicts between
        her and her own sisters Unity and Diana, ardent proponents of Nazism. This introduction to racism, ethnic cleansing, and Nazism later become essential allegories to Rowling's series. Rowling even states that the Harry Potter phrases 'pure-blood',
        'half-blood' and 'Muggle-born' compared to "some of the real charts the Nazis used to show what constituted 'Aryan' or 'Jewish' blood.

    <h2>Education and Inspiration...</h2>
    <p><span class="year">1983 </span>Rowling moved on to get a B.A. in french and Classics at Exeter University. She was a soft-spoken, competant but albeit forgetable student. Rowling often remembers preferring listening to The Smiths and reading Dickens
      and Tolkien to studying. However, superficial observations of Rowling were misleading, as Classics such as <span class="ital">Iliad</span> and personal readings such as <span class="ital">A Tale of Two Cities</span> and <span class="ital">Lord of the Rings</span>      further sparked her imagination and directly influenced her later work.</p>
    <p><span class="year">1986 </span>Upon graduating, Rowling went to work as a researcher and bilingual secretary at Amnesty International. While attempting to protect human rights at Amnesty International, J. K. Rowling was exposed to the darker parts
      of human nature all around. Here she conceived the idea for her Harry Potter series realizing "imagination is what allows us to empathize with people who have suffered horribly and to act on their behalf."</p>
    <p><span class="year">1990 </span>Motion seems to be a common thread for genius ideas. Charles Dickens walked through London at night working on plots, Mark Twain was known as a constant pacer. Research out of Standford University found people on treadmills
      produced more creative ideas. Therefore, it should be no surprise, that it was while on a train trip from Manchester to London, the idea for a story of a young boy attending a school of wizardry "came fully formed" in Rowling's mind.</p>

  <h2>The Nadir...</h2>

  <div class="child2">
    <p><span class="year">1990 </span>Rowling's mother died after suffering ten years from multiple schlerosis. Rowling never told her mother about her writing but used her own feeling of loss to influence Harry's in her first book. Rowling moved to Porto,
      Portugal to teach English. She taught at night and wrote during the day. </p>
    <p><span class="year">1992-93 </span>Rowling met Portugese television journalist Jorge Arantes in a bar after discovering their shared love for Jane Austen. They married and had a child Jessic Isabel Rowling Arantes. Four months later, the couple separated
      and Rowling moved with her infant daughter to Edinburg Scotland.
     <p><span class="year">1993-95 </span>Seven years after graduating, her marriage had failed, she was jobless, on welfare, and now had a dependent child. During this period, Rowling was diagnosed with clinical depression. Her illness inspired
        her characters known as Dementors, soul-sucking creatures introduced in her third book. Rowling turned all her attention to writing. She often wrote in cafes where she could get her daughter to fall asleep. </p>

    <h2>Rags to Riches...</h2>
    <p><span class="year">1995 </span>Rowling finished her manuscript for <span class="ital">Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</span> on an old manuscript type writer. Christopher Little Literary Agents eagerly agreed to represent Rowling. The book
      was sent to twelve publishing houses which all rejected the manuscript.
      <p><span class="year">1996 </span>A year later, Rowling received the green light by editor Barry Cunningham from Bloomsbury. The decision came when the eight-year-old daughter of Bloomsbury chairman Alice Newton demanded the next chapter after being
        given the first chapter to review. Anticipating that the target audience of young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman, her publishers asked that she use two initials rather than her full name. As she had no middle name, she chose
        K (for "Kathleen") as the second initial of her pen name, from her paternal grandmother. Joanne Rowling officially became J. K. Rowling.</p>
      <p><span class="year">1998 </span>An auction was held in the United States for right to publish the novel. The auction was won by Scholastic Inc. for $105,000 and Scholastic changed the title to <span class="ital">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</span>.</p>
